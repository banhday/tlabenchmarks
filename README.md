 
## Welcome to TLA<sup>+</sup> Benchmarks 

The page **TLA<sup>+</sup> Benchmarks** is a library of TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications for distributed algorithms. The webpage supplies the TLA<sup>+</sup> community with:

- A comprehensive library of the TLA<sup>+</sup> specifications that are available today, in order to provide an overview of how to specify an algorithm in TLA<sup>+</sup>.
- A comprehensive list of references and other interesting information for each problem.

Do you have your own case study that you like to share with the community? Send a pointer to us and we will include it in the repository. Your specifications will help the community in improving the tools for TLA<sup>+</sup> analysis.
