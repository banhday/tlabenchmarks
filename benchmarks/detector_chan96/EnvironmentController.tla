(* - This specification instances two other specs, Age_Channel.tla for the communication 
     system, and EPFailureDetector.tla for behaviors of correct processses.
     
   - Every message sent by some process is wrapped into a box with an age which shows 
     how long this message have been in transit. Boxes for messages which were sent 
     but have not been delivered are stored in a variable inTransit.
     
   - Messages which are delivered in the current transition are stored in a variable
     inDelivery.
     
   - The system tracks what last transition a process takes, and how long some correct
     process has not taken a transition. The information are saved in variables moved
     and procPause, respectively. Crashes are also tracked.
     
   - Every process has its own local clock which is localClock[i].
    
   - Every correct process repeatedly sends "alive" messages to other processes, and 
     repeatedly make predictions about failures. However, a process cannot send and 
     predict at the same time. A process can receive messages when it does not execute 
     neither the operation SEND nor the operation PREDICT.
          
   - "alive" messages are created by calling the operator MakeAliveMsgsForAll in
     EPFailureDetector, and then stored in outgoingMessages.
       
   - In this specification, a correct process sends "alive" messages to others at every
     SendPoint tick of its local clock, and makes predictions about failures at every 
     PredictPoint tick of its local clock. Formally, we have that 
      a) localClock[i] % SendPoint = 0 /\ localClock[i] % PredictPoint # 0: a process
         executes the operation Send 
      b) localClock[i] % SendPoint # 0 /\ localClock[i] % PredictPoint = 0: a process
         executes the operation Predict
      c) \/ localClock[i] % SendPoint = 0 /\ localClock[i] % PredictPoint = 0
         \/ localClock[i] % SendPoint # 0 /\ localClock[i] % PredictPoint # 0 : a process
         executes the operation Receive
         
   - The predictions are saved in a variable suspected. If j \in suspected[i], a process
     p_i suspects that a process p_j crashed.
     
   - Every process p_i has a waiting time, called delta[i][j], for hearing some messages 
     for other process p_j. Moreover, a process tracks how long it hasn't receive any
     message from p_j, and stores the information in a variable fromLastHeard[i][j].
      
   - When a process p_i executes the action Predict, if p_i hasn't received any message
     from p_j for a too long period, e.g. fromLastHeard[i][j] > delta[i][j], p_i puts 
     p_j into its suspected list.
        
   o The keypoints in this specification is the way we encode the environmental clock,
     and local clocks of processes. This encoding technique makes our system become
     a finite one, if all parameters are fixed.
      
      1/ In this specification, instead of directly encoding the environmental clocks, 
      we focus on their effects on variables describing message delay, and relative 
      speeds of processes. The action EnvTick simulates an event of a global tick.
      When the action EnvTick is executed, a box with a message inside attains a 
      new age, and every pause of a process p_i, named procPause[i], is increased
      by 1.
    
      2/ Every local lock in this specification has a finite domain, instead of a
      infinite one. Whenever the value of its local clock is greater than SendPoint,
      PredictPoint, and delta[i][j], the local clock is reset to 0. Because of the 
      constraints about message delay and relative speeds of differnt processes in 
      partial synchrony, the upper bound of local clocks exists.   
                                                                
      3/ After fromLastHeard[i][j] is greated than delta[i][j], we don't need to 
      increase fromLastHeard[i][j].                                                                           
  
   + We have used TLC to check the correctness of Strong Completeness and Eventually
     Strong Accuracy in small instances    
      - Strong Completeness: Eventually every process that crashes is permanently 
        suspected by every correct process. 
      - Eventually Strong Accuracy: There is a time after which correct processes 
        are not suspected by any correct process.
      - Case N = 3, T = 1, d0 = 2, SendPoint = 2, PredictPoint = 3, DELTA = PHI = 1:
        TLC spends more than 2 hours (from 11:17 to 13:26) verifying these properties.
      
   o PROBLEMS with TLC: I believe that PHIConstraint and PHIConstraint1 are equivalent. 
     However, whenever I check this specification with PHIConstraing1, TLC shows an 
     error: "Too many possible next states for the last state in the trace." I guess 
     that the reasons are from optimizations for disjunctions. *)

(* Two constraints PHIConstraint and DELTAConstraint are respectively restrictions on
   message delay and relative speeds of processes in partial synchronoy. We use these 
   constraints to filter out executions. Only executions satisfying these constraints
   are allowed in the computation model of partial synchrony.  
     - PHIConstraint: In any contiguous subinterval containing PHI real-time steps, 
       every correct processor must take at least one step. In this specification, 
       this constraint is violated if there is a correct process such that the associated
       procPause is greater then PHI.
     - DELTAConstraint: If message m is placed in p_j’s buffer by some Send(m, p_j)  
       at a time s_1, and if p_j executes a Receive(p_j) at a time s_2 such that
       s_2 >= s_1 + DELTA, then m must be delivered to pj at time s_2 or earlier.
       This restriction is captured by the 1st conjunction in DELTAConstranti. 
       However, this constraint doesn't mention anything about messages sent to crashed
       processes which cannot execute the operation Receive. In this specification,
       we assume that the maximum delay of messages sent to crashed processes are DELTA
       real-time steps. In other words, the maximum ages of associated boxes in transit 
       are DELTA. *)
